Having dedicated my career to healthcare and academia, I am deeply committed to preparing the next generation of healthcare leaders. I have taught these concepts since 2017 and found that many books either do not focus enough on healthcare as it relates to the legal realm or are too in depth for a introductory course.

Therefore, I wanted to design a textbook at no cost that would complement any undergraduate law course for healthcare administration and health science students. I encourage faculty users to explore the topics and concepts that may help teach the fundamentals of healthcare law.
